-- pzopt: "Optimizations" tab in the options screen, right after Display.
--  Every pzopt.Config key is a control here: booleans are tick boxes, integers are combos whose first
--  entry is the build's default on this machine. The values live in Java: the overridden
--  PerformanceSettings forwards to pzopt.Config (what is in force since boot) and pzopt.UserOptions
--  (Zomboid/pzopt/options.ini, what the next launch will read). Everything applies on the next
--  launch, so a change away from the boot value raises the stock "restart required" dialog.
--  A key set in the install dir's pzopt.properties or as -Dpzopt.<key> (harness runs) wins over the
--  file; its control shows that value, is disabled, and the tooltip says what pins it.
--  The top of the tab is the master switch (key `enabled`): off = every override takes its stock
--  path, the same as a build mismatch, whatever the other keys say. "Disable all (stock)" turns it
--  off; "Enable all" turns it on and puts every other control back to the build's defaults.
--  Both only change the controls; Apply / Accept saves them like any other option.
--  Right of the controls sits the preview panel (PzoptPreview, fixed while the list scrolls): for the
--  setting under the mouse it plays two clips side by side, the stock game and the optimized build on the
--  same route (animated GIFs under media/ui/pzopt/compare/, made by harness/menu-gifs.py, decoded by
--  pzopt.GifTextures), shows the setting's description and its value now / at the next launch, and draws
--  one bar per resource (game thread, render thread, other cores, GPU, VRAM, RAM, disk, load time, chunk
--  arrival) from the EFFECTS table below: left = less work / sooner, right = more. Which clip a setting
--  shows is its section's `clip`, overridden per key in KEY_CLIP.
-- Installed by scripts/pzopt.sh into <game dir>/media/lua/client/pzopt/ (loose game-dir Lua is
-- loaded like any other, no mod to enable).
